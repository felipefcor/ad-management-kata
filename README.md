# Ad Management kata
In this Kata we have 4 sprints to achieve an Ad Management.

I have divided the sprints in branches in Github to make more easy to the read the iteration of the project. 

As an overview, I try to explain how I considered to start.

After a several time thinking, I decided to start for Ad Management Service and create the design core of the app in that class. After that I began to construct piece a piece with special focus to repositories.

Another significant issue it was I decided to use DTO to access to inner propierties of the classes trying to avoid primitive obsession and do a lot of getters and setters.

Also to consider I used an Strategy Pattern to set up the diferent expiration or remove of the ads in the purge method.
